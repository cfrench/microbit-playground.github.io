This program shows a random message when the micro:bit is shaken. It's similar to the 8-balls in real life! You can customise and hack the code with
your own messages.


{% highlight python %}
{% include_relative 2016-02-17-8-ball.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

###  How it Works

#### Messages Array

{% highlight python %}
MESSAGES = ["It is certain",
            "Dont count on it",
            "Ask again",
            "Perhaps",
            "Do not bet on it,"]
{% endhighlight %}

Each of the messages is held in an array. An array is a data structure that holds multiple values. In this example, the array has 5 values and each one is a string (or text).

The array can be arranged on multiple lines or on a single line:

{% highlight python %}

MESSAGES = ["It is certain", "Dont count on it", "Ask again",]

{% endhighlight %}

#### .is_gesture(`shake`)

{% highlight python %}
if microbit.accelerometer.is_gesture('shake') is True:
{% endhighlight %}

This uses the the `shake` function to detect if the micro:bit has been shaken. If it is True (the micro:bit has been shaken) it generates a random message. The [API for the `accelerometer` module lists other gestures that can be uesd.](http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/accelerometer.html)

| accelerometer gestures								| 
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `up` | `down` | `left` | `right` | `face up` | `face down` |
| `freefall` | `3g` | `6g` | `8g` | `shake` |

#### random.choice(MESSAGES)

{% highlight python %}
microbit.display.scroll(random.choice(MESSAGES))
{% endhighlight %}


Translated into English, this code is:  _scroll on the display a random choice from the MESSAGES array_. `random.choice` is useful when we want to pick something at random. The `random` module can be used to pick numbers at random: `random.randrange(0, 100)` returns a random number from 0---100. There are more functions on the [micro:bit's API page](http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/random.html).

To use `random` you need to import it at the beginning of the program: 

{% highlight python %}
import microbit from *
import random
{% endhighlight %}


### What to `import` and when

So when should you import modules? It's very simple to understand. You will only ever need to import 3 other modules: neopixel, random and music:

`import neopixel`: Import this to connect to a neopixel. I doubt you'll need this!

`import random`: Import this to use random numbers. Anything beginning `random.` needs this module.

`import music`: Import this to  make a sound on your micro:bit. Anything beginning `music.` will need this module.

**RULE**: you only need to `import` a module if your code needs random numbers, makes a sound or uses a neopixel. Most of the time you will
just use `import microbit from *`
