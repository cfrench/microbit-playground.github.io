How did you learn to code? Did you diligently work through a textbook? I bet you didn't.

##  How Coding Begins


Most adults begin wrting code by mashing preexisiting code; kids are no different. The projects on this site provide the code for kids to mash. 

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}

foo = 'Hello'
bar = 'world'

puts "#{foo} #{bar} Are you inspired by my program?


{% endhighlight %}

There are many entry points for kids to learn how to use their Micro:bit. We seek to occupy that gap between visual block-based programming and text-based languages with a full-blown IDE.

## Grab Them; Inspire Them

A picture of something inspiration goes here.

No one has ever been inspired by _hello world_ or _foobar_; what is foobar anyway? You can write Micro:bit projects to captivate kids and encourages them to experiment. Through experimentation they learn how a language works. 

> If inspired, they can hack their learning; they can fill in the blanks.

It all begins with them being inspired.

## Computational Thinking != Programming

It's better to learn Ruby, or Erlang or
