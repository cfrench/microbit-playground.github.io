### TODO
* Commission illustrator for splash logo. (& remove copyright Micro:bit logo.
* Push to Git repo.


### Visual Style
* Looks professional
* Competes with and differentiates itself from other options.
* Site used by teenagers. Nothing patronising.
* Active voice
* Purposefully lacking colours; vivid splashing of colour from from code. _let the code do the talking &trade;_


### Front Page Splash Image

Professional-looking vector animation to convey the ease of programming a Micro:bit with Python.

Code is shown appearing letter-by-letter on the IDE as if a user were typing it.

{% highlight python %}

from microbit import *
microbit.display.show(Image.SMILE)

{% endhighlight %}

Once the code is written, the mouse cursor clicks 'run' and the micro:bit appears to run the code and update its display.

`SMILE` is deleted by the ghost user and replaced with `PITCHFORK` or `COW` or `DIAMOND` or `CHESSBOARD` etc., the Micro:bit updates its display at each new attribute.

Conveys ease of use.

Cartoony backdrop underneath + outer glow. I love outer glow
