### Why is the Microbit Important for Education?

Many reasons. For me the most important is the ability of the micro:bit to run Python. Instead of teaching Python by moving a turtle around the screen, the kids can write programs that are genuinely interesting. [I have written up my thoughts here.](/teachers/why-python-microbit)

#### _I received the micro:bits; now what?_

Point them in the direction of Microsoft Block Editor on [microbit.co.uk](http://microbit.co.uk). It feels much like Scratch and has exceptional tutorials.

To use their micro:bit they'll need to connect it to a computer so they can flash their code. The micro:bit will be powered from the computer's USB bus.

Microbit ships with, in boxes of 50:

* microbit
* quick start guide
* usb cable
* battery box
* batteries
