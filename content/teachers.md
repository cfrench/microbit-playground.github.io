Teaching resources for the micro:bit are non-existent. All tutorials and projects are geared towards kids. These are all one-off projects with no plan for progression. If you have anything please send consider open sourcing it and emailing it or upload to [CAS](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk).

### News
_updated 20.03.2016_ 

#### _I received the micro:bits; now what?_

Point them in the direction of Microsoft Block Editor on [microbit.co.uk](http://microbit.co.uk). It feels much like Scratch and has exceptional tutorials.

To use their micro:bit they'll need to connect it to a computer so they can flash their code. The micro:bit will be powered from the computer's USB bus.

The micro:bit needs power if it's to be mobile:

* USB battery mobile phone charger
* 2AAA battery holder with JST connector

The battery holders are cheapest at Kitronik but they, like everyone else, are sold out. The teacher kits shipped with USB leads and battery holders; hopefully the kids will have them too.

#### _Do I have to give them to the kids?_

Yes. The BBC has said in its material and adverts that the kids will get them to own (and not be kept in school).

#### Relax, it's not a Teaching Project

I beleive the launch is 'give kids a micro:bit to tinker with'; it's not a project for teachers & schools. The educational potential is massive and their use could be incorporated into planning the 2016/2017 school year when class packs will be available.

## Teaching Resources

This is the most comprehensive list of resources for teachers on the internet (sorry!). See the [links page](/links/) for more general links.
