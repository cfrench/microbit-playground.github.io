Teaching resources for the micro:bit are non-existent. All tutorials and projects are geared towards kids. These are all one-off projects with no plan for progression. If you have anything please send consider open sourcing it and emailing it or upload to [CAS](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk).

### News

#### _I received the micro:bits; now what?_

Point them in the direction of Microsoft Block Editor on [microbit.co.uk](http://microbit.co.uk). It feels much like Scratch and has exceptional tutorials.

To use their micro:bit they'll need to connect it to a computer so they can flash their code. The micro:bit will be powered from the computer's USB bus.

Microbit ships with, in boxes of 50:

* microbit
* quick start guide
* usb cable
* battery box
* batteries
