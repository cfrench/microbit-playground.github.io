### Mistakes

I'm very new to all this licensing stuff. Do give me a shout if I've done some wrong.

### Other Fun Stuff

This site is not associated with the Python Foundation or any of its projects. We admire from afar.

### More Fun Stuff

<a href="http://microbit.co.uk/"> 'BBC' and 'microbit'</a> are trade marks of the BBC. We're not associated with them either!
